# [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) Learning Challenges
## Motivation

Although I was aware of #TidyTuesday and #RStats, I hadn't tried my hand at them. This summer (July 2024), I decided to dive deeper and hone my visualization and data wrangling skills with new datasets. As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to share my journey through the weekly TidyTuesday learning challenges. This folder contains the datasets I've used, my analysis scripts, and visualizations created along the way. 

## What is TidyTuesday

TidyTuesday is an amazing weekly social data project that encourages us to dive into diverse datasets and practice data wrangling, visualization, and analysis using data science tools. Each week, we get a new dataset to explore, providing endless opportunities to learn and grow.

## Package Acknowledgment

I use the following packages in my workflow: `tidyverse`, `janitor`, `here`, `readr`, `patchwork`, `ggrepel`, `ggtext`, and `showtext`. For each week, I include the new packages I'm trying.

## Repository Structure

- **scripts/**:  Contains Rmd for analyzing the datasets and creating visualizations for each week
- **products/**: Contains finalized products I created

Each file has a date in its name for management purposes.
