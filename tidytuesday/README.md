# [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) Learning Challenges
## Motivation

Although I was aware of #TidyTuesday and #RStats, I hadn't tried my hand at them. This summer (July 2024), I decided to dive deeper and hone my visualization and data wrangling skills with new datasets. As a data enthusiast, I'm excited to share my journey through the weekly TidyTuesday learning challenges. This folder contains the datasets I've used, my analysis scripts, and visualizations created along the way. 

## What is TidyTuesday

TidyTuesday is an amazing weekly social data project that encourages us to dive into diverse datasets and practice data wrangling, visualization, and analysis using data science tools. Each week, we get a new dataset to explore, providing endless opportunities to learn and grow.

## Repository Structure

- **scripts/**:  Contains Rmd for analyzing the datasets and creating visualizations for each week
- **products/**: Contains finalized products I created

Each file has a date in its name for management purposes.

## Weekly Projects

### July 16 (Week 29)

**Data:** [The English Women's Football (EWF) Database](https://github.com/probjects/ewf-database)

**Packages:** `tidyverse` and `gganimate`

**Question:** How has the team ranking (teams with highest wins) evolve over time in the Women's Super League Tier 1?

**Approach:** Created a racing bar chart to show team with most wins across seasons

**Interesting finding:** After 2018, a lot of teams changed their names going away from Ladies to Women. For example, Arsenal Ladies/Chelsea Ladies to Arsenal Women/Chelsea Women. That's why the abruptness of the bars seem to stand out.

**Acknowledgment:** I followed this [blogpost](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/01/how-to-create-bar-race-animation-charts-in-r/) to learn about racing bars in R. 

### July 23 (Week 30)

**Data:** [American Idol Database](https://github.com/kkakey/American_Idol)

**Packages:** `tidyverse`; `ggimage`; `patchwork`; `showtext`; `ggrepel`

**Question:** 
1. Which artist's songs were performed by the most contestants in each season of American Idol?
2. What is the relationship between Audition States and Birthplace of Finalist's States?

**Approach:** Created an inforgraphics and contigency plot
