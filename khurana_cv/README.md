# Reproducible CV using R

## Motivation

Maintaining a CV can be time-consuming and inconsistent, and to be honest, not my favorite things to do. To address this, I am motivated to create a reproducible CV using R. This approach ensures my CV is always up-to-date, integrates new data seamlessly, and supports multiple formats like PDF and HTML. This project combines my passion for data science with the practical need for efficient professional documentation.

## Steps

- In the [data](data) folder, I added experiences/achievements/accomplishments in different buckets. It took some trial and error, and I followed [Daniel Anderson's](https://github.com/datalorax/anderson-cv) data organization design as he was my instructor for the [Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/epol/specialization-educational-data-science) course and I just loved how he organizes things. I routinely edit it.

- Next, choose/design a template. I used the [`vitae`](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package and in-built templates and functions to organize my work.

## Some future improvements (probably need LaTeX code but I am yet to invest time)

- Changing color scheme 
- Changing font style for text
- Adding custom footnotes, like made with <3 in R.
- Adding 3-column style format for references.

## How the CV turned out?
