# Reproducible CV using R

## Motivation

Maintaining a CV can be time-consuming and inconsistent, and to be honest, not my favorite things to do. To address this, I am motivated to create a reproducible CV using R. This approach ensures my CV is always up-to-date, integrates new data seamlessly, and supports multiple formats like PDF and HTML. This project combines my passion for data science with the practical need for efficient professional documentation.

## Update

As a first set, I'm adding creating datasets that document the various items on the CV. Next, I will look for formats to incorporate this information.
