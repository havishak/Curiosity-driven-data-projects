# Eugene [Butte to Butte](https://buttetobutte.com/) Results Data

**Motivation:** I am in Eugene, OR, and there is massive running and track culture in the town. Each year on July 4th the butte (Spencer Butte) to butte (Skinner butte) happens and this year, my husbannd and I decied to participate. As I was registering us, i realized there is a challenge open - to answer in which year did participants from all 50 states participate in the race. I also realized there is a results page on the website that archives all past year results (going back to 2000) though the race started in 1974. I decided this might be a good opportunitiy to sharper my web-scrapping skills to answer this question. So, here's the context of the project.  

**Approach:** In this project, I scraped the results of the Eugene Butte to Butte race, which takes place on every 4th of July in Eugene Oregon, to create a dataset which has participant-level (de-identified) information for all years for which results are public. Then, I used the resulting dataset to find which  year had participants. beyond answering this question, the dataset can be used to answer other race-related questions though I didn't spend much time diving into it.

I am in Eugene, OR, and there is a massive running and track culture in the town. Each year on July 4th, the Butte (Spencer Butte) to Butte (Skinner Butte) race happens. This year, my husband and I decided to participate. As I was registering us, I realized there is a challenge open - to determine in which year participants from all 50 states participated in the race. I also discovered a results page on the website that archives all past year results (going back to 2000), even though the race started in 1974. I decided this might be a good opportunity to sharpen my web-scraping skills to answer this question. So, here's the context of the project.
